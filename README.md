This project demonstrates the use of different Conflict-Based Search (CBS) algorithms to find collision-free paths for multiple agents in a maze-like grid.

## CBS Algorithm(CBS Folder)


### Files

- `main.py`: Main script to initialize agents, define the maze, and solve the multi-agent pathfinding problem.
- `cbs.py`: Must be available in the same directory. This should contain the `CBSSolver` class used to solve the pathfinding problem.

### How to Run

1. **Ensure the required files are present**:
    - `main.py`
    - `cbs.py` 

2. **Run the main script**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
## MA-CBS Algorithm(MA_CBS Folder)   

### Files

- `main.py`: Main script to initialize agents, define the maze, and solve the multi-agent pathfinding problem.
- `cbs_ma.py`: Must be available in the same directory. This should contain the `CBSSolver` class used to solve the pathfinding problem.

### How to Run

1. **Ensure the required files are present**:
    - `main.py`
    - `cbs_ma.py` 

2. **Run the main script**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## EECBS Algorithm(EECBS Folder)

### How to Run

1. **Ensure the required files are present**:
    - `run_experiments_manual.py`
    - `eecbs.py` 

2. **Run the main script**:
    ```bash
    python run_experiments_manual.py --solver EECBS
    ```

# This project demonstrates the use of different Conflict-Based Search (CBS) algorithms to find collision-free paths for multiple agents in a maze-like grid.

# CBS Algorithm(CBS Folder)


## Files

- `main.py`: Main script to initialize agents, define the maze, and solve the multi-agent pathfinding problem.
- `cbs.py`: Must be available in the same directory. This should contain the `CBSSolver` class used to solve the pathfinding problem.

## How to Run

1. **Ensure the required files are present**:
    - `main.py`
    - `cbs.py` 

2. **Run the main script**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
# MA-CBS Algorithm(MA_CBS Folder)   

## Files

- `main.py`: Main script to initialize agents, define the maze, and solve the multi-agent pathfinding problem.
- `cbs_ma.py`: Must be available in the same directory. This should contain the `CBSSolver` class used to solve the pathfinding problem.

## How to Run

1. **Ensure the required files are present**:
    - `main.py`
    - `cbs_ma.py` 

2. **Run the main script**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

# EECBS Algorithm(EECBS Folder)

## How to Run

1. **Ensure the required files are present**:
    - `run_experiments_manual.py`
    - `eecbs.py` 

2. **Run the main script**:
    ```bash
    python run_experiments_maunal.py --solver EECBS
    ```
